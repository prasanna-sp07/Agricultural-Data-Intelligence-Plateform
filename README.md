This project is an Agricultural Data Intelligence Platform designed to help farmers make smarter decisions on irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting. It combines soil type, crop variety, growth stage, and rainfall inputs with weather‑based logic to generate 7‑day recommendations. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, with mock APIs that can be easily replaced by real weather services. The web app provides irrigation percentages, nitrogen suggestions, and risk indicators in a clean, responsive dashboard. It is intended as a hackathon‑ready prototype for a data‑driven, farm‑management SaaS product.
